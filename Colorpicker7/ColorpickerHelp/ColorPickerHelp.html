<font size=+3>ColorPicker by Anna-Carin</font>, beta-version
2003.
<br><b>Introduction</b>
<br>This utlility is fairly the same as the colorpicker in Adobe Photoshop.
The web-safe color option has been omitted since the web has developed
to accept 24 bit RGB-colors. Additions are the picture-option, that is
you can have a number of (max 256) favourite pics which you use as your palette.
Furthermore there is a button for switching a color to its complementary
counterpart. Useful for choosing matching colors at design work. There
is also a quick memory function, similar to the button M&lt;>R on&nbsp;
mini-calculators.
<p><b>Color basics</b>
<br>You should understand a few concepts of color before reading further.
<br>- Color circle: The whole bunch of possible colors (Hue) to be seen
by the human eye is present in the rainbow. A practical model is to distribute
these colors evenly on a circle. To save space the circle in ColorPicker
has been reshaped to a pillar.

<br>All colors (almost) can be achieved by mixing the three colors RED,
GREEN and BLUE.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Based on the human perception of color, the HSB model describes three
fundamental characteristics of color:
<br>•&nbsp; Hue is the color reflected from or transmitted through an object.
It is measured as a location on the standard color wheel, expressed as
a degree between 0&deg; and 360&deg; . In common use, hue is identified
by the name of the color such as red, brown, or green.
<br>•&nbsp; Saturation, sometimes called chroma, is the strength or purity
of the color. Saturation represents the amount of gray in proportion to
the hue, measured as a percentage from 0% (gray) to 100% (fully saturated).
On the standard color wheel, saturation increases from the center to the
edge.
<br>•&nbsp; Brightness is the relative lightness or darkness of the color,
usually measured as a percentage from 0% (black) to 100% (white).

<p><b>The different color models/modes in ColorPicker</b>

<br>1. The first radio button stands for Hue and gives a Hue spectrum on
the pillarshaped picturebox and a 2-dimensional shading in the big picturebox..
Since the spectrum actually is a circle it is measured in 0 to 360 degrees
in the numerical textbox.

<br>2. The second radio button stands for Saturation and displays a saturation
slider on the thin picturebox while the big box shows a hue spectrum with
fading lightness.
<br>3. The brightness radio button displays a brightness slider on the
thin picturebox while the big box shows a hue spectrum with fading brightness.
<br>4. The RED radio button displays a brightness slider on the thin picturebox
while the big box shows a 90 degrees crossfade between green &amp; blue
on a static red bottom.
